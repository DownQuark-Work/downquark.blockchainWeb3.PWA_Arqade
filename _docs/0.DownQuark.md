## Dapp Statement
> ### _Fostering Blockchain Adoption by Removing the Scary Bits._

- The primary focus of the application being created is to create content that users will truly enjoy interacting with.
- The secondary objective is to allow users to _interact_ with, and _learn_ about, cryptocurrencies and the blockchain using non-technical methods, leading to non-intimidated Users..

A benefit of this approach is that those who _are_ familiar with web3, will have no competitve advantage over those that have just begun the crypto journey.

## Dapp Vision

By Creating an Easy to Use, Easy to Understand Application, We Are Trying to do Our Part to Inform Others, Remove the Stigma, and Watch as Blockchain Reaches its Full Potential._
