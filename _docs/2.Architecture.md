# Architecture
> Note: While _technically_ a single repo, the directories contained within will all functoin as though they were their own repository.
> - With the exception of the `Extension`. That is designed to functoin as a _mono-repo_ to allow for easy additions of future games/apps.

## Source Directories
> WARNING
> >: The folders within the `_src` directory have been modified to contain [symlinks](https://ss64.com). Take caution if/when relocating them to prevent build failures
>
> View the **File Structure** _tree_ below for moreinformation.

### File Structure

### Acronyms
#### - SOC
> _Separation of Concerns_
>
Each "concern" has a dedicated directory within one or more "_categorizing_" parent folders
> e.g. `protocol/onchain/Solidity`
> Is the _only_ directory that will contain `.sol` files which will be deployed onto the blockchain
> Likewise `web3/Extension` will be the _only_ directory handling the files relating to the [PWA](https://web.dev/progressive-web-apps/)

#### - DRY
> _Don't Repeat Yourself_
>
There is one issue crated by adhering to the _Separation Rules_ above.
- _What to do with the well written, reusable, code that cannot be exported/imported from beyond it's root project folder_⁉️
> e.g. The user avatar component shoudld be used on _both_ the **Extension** and the **Browser** applications
> - To rewrite it breaks the _DRY_ rule, and moving it outside of the styleguide breaks the _SOC_ rule

_The solution:_
- **Symlinks**

### Symlinks
Symlinks allow us to write code a single time in a logical location, and then create a _pointer_ to allow another location to access the code.
1. **DRY**: code exists in only 1 location
2. **SOC**: code exists in correct scope as explained above

## Example
Continuing with the _**Style Guide**_ example:
1. `PseduoComponent` would be created at:
   - `_src/common/DesignSystem/PseudoComponent/`
1. run a simple command from the `_src` dircectory:
   - `$ ln -s common/DesignSystem/PseudoComponent web3/Browser/components`
   - `$ ln -s common/DesignSystem/PseudoComponent web3/Extension/components`
1. you can now access the component by importing it from a file within the same paroject!
   - e.g. `import PsedoComponent from '../Browser/components`
