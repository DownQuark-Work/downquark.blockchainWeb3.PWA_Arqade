# Components

The `components/` folder contains everything that takes part in laying out the site or application. This folder could have stylesheets for the main parts of the site (header, footer, navigation, sidebarâ€¦), the grid system or even CSS styles for all the forms.

Reference: [Sass Guidelines](http://sass-guidelin.es/) > [Architecture](http://sass-guidelin.es/#architecture) > [Layout folder](http://sass-guidelin.es/#components-folder)

> NOTE: to follow the best practices of react each component will import their individual stylesheet(s). `_common.scss` is reserved for shared styles between all components.
