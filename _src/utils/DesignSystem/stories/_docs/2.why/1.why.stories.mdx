# Why Use Storybook?
<p><quote>&ldquo;Storybook is a powerful frontend workshop environment tool that allows teams to design, build, and organize UI components (and even full screens!) without getting tripped up over business logic and plumbing.&rdquo;</quote></p>
<p><i>Storybook provides a sandbox to build UI components in isolation so you can develop hard-to-reach states and edge cases</i></p>
<p><b>Build components in isolation</b><br/>Create components without needing to stand up screens, fuss with data, or build business logic.</p>
<p><b>Mock hard to reach use cases</b><br/>Render components in key states that are tricky to reproduce in an app.</p>
<p><b>Document use cases as stories</b><br/>Save use cases as stories in plain JavaScript to revisit during development, testing, and QA.</p>
