<h1>Build Components in Isolation</h1><p>Design systems aren&rsquo;t apps; they ship only production UI components.</p>
<p>In addition to decoupling logic from layout the structural patterns of Design Systems helps decouple the design from the development. Allowing designers to adjust the styling without interfering with the structure.</p>
<p>The main thing they all have in common is that they separate the UI/UX from the logic. This allows components to look the same across multiple applications, but have unique logic for each. Which immediately decreases the complexity of code needed for each implementation.</p>
<p>Utilizing <a target="_blank" href="https://speakerdeck.com/hagenburger/style-guide-driven-development">Style Guide Driven Development</a> companies get the flexibility of reusable UI/UX without the limitations and code bloat of third parties.</p>
<p>Utilize the <a class="link" href="https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/" target="_blank">Atomic Design Pattern</a> for structure and consistency.</p>
