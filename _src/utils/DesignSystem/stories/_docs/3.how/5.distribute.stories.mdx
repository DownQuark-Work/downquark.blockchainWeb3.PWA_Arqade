<h1>Distribute the design system to consumer projects</h1>
<p>Now that your UI components are durable, peer-reviewed, regression-tested, and documented, you need a mechanism to distribute them to other teams.</p>
<p>Design systems are distributed as versioned packages via a package manager (e.g., npm), to be easily imported into projects when needed.</p>
<p>With Storybook, we also get the added bonus of being able to view previous versions of the component alongside the current one to view past changes.</p>
