<h1>What is a Pattern Library?</h1>
      <p>A pattern library - which may also be referred to as a component library - is a central and digitalized collection of a brandâ€™s reusable assets.</p>
      <p>Naturally, this focuses more on the UI; you canâ€™t &ldquo;re-use&rdquo; words in this manner. While there may be some automation, most pattern libraries involve designers and developers going in and taking existing assets to create or develop materials.</p>
