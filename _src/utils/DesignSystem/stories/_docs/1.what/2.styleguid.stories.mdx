# What is a Style Guide?

When presented with the problem of how to maintain visual consistency between multiple projects companies from <a target="_blank" href="https://material.io/components">Google</a> to <a target="_blank" href="https://polaris.shopify.com/components/get-started">Shopify</a> have used Style Guides to help achieve a solution

Microsoft goes as far as <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/welcome/">defining</a> the grammar and &ldquo;feel&rdquo; of writing that should be applied to each and every file created. While <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/">Apple</a> takes a more holistic approach. Some companies such as <a target="_blank" href="https://ant.design/">Ant</a> adapt their guides to cover many different frameworks

A Style Guide is a company&rsquo;s rules regarding its branding - this covers both visual elements, such as logos and imagery, as well as written content, such as tone of voice

It defines how the company is represented throughout online, offline, in-house, and external appearances. Style guides define how a company wants to represent, whether it's via a choice of color, the prominence of the logo, or the language and tone used in materials

For the most part, there is nothing technical about a style guide - it is a purely written set of rules
