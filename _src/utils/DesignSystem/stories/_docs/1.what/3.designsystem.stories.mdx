# What is a Design System?
A design system provides complete documentation and branding standards, using automation to provide consistency and faster time-to-market for both developers and designers.

The main differentiator of a design system is that its assets arenâ€™t copied and pasted to each application or website - theyâ€™re directly recalled in-code. As such, when these apps load, they load the most recent rulings in the design system. A change in the system is instantly reflected in the products and materials.

As for components, most design systems focus on â€˜atomic design theoryâ€™. When every larger component (called organisms) is made from smaller components (molecules), and those molecules are made of individual assets (atoms), a change at the atomic level ripples upwards.

For example, a singular webpage may feature a form. This form is an organism created from buttons and fields (molecules). These are defined by the atoms - such as color, font, spacing, etc - of the design system. These same atoms also define the form on a mobile app, for example. Changing the color in the design system itself then changes the color across all these forms - and any other organisms calling these assets - as it becomes updated.
